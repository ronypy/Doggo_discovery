# Web Development Project 4 – *Doggo Information*

**Submitted by:** Md Rakibul Hasan
**This web app:** Doggo Discovery! is a React web app that fetches random dog images and displays key breed attributes (breed, weight, origin, lifespan) using TheDogAPI. Its interactive ban list lets users filter out unwanted attribute values, ensuring each “Discover!” click brings only the dogs you want to see.
**Time spent:** 5 hours total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **API fetch button & display**  
  - A button triggers a new API call on click  
  - Displays at least three consistent attributes and an image from the JSON response  
- [X] **Single result view**  
  - Only one item from the API response is visible at a time  
  - Displayed attributes always match the shown image  
  - At least one image per fetch  
- [X] **Randomized results**  
  - Each click produces a seemingly random new result  
  - API has a large dataset; repeats are permitted but infrequent  
- [X] **Interactive Ban List**  
  - At least one attribute per result is clickable  
  - Clicking an attribute **not** in the ban list adds it immediately  
  - Clicking an attribute **in** the ban list removes it immediately  
- [X] **Ban-list filtering**  
  - Once banned, that attribute’s values are never shown again on subsequent fetches  
  - (E.g., if “Siberian” is banned, no Siberian cat/dog will ever appear again)
